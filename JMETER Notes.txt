How to execute JMETER test
============================

=> We need to create JMETER test in GUI mode and we should execute it in CLI mode.


Note: It is not recommended to run JMETER test in GUI mode.


Syntax To Run JMETER Test : jmeter -n -t [jmx file] -l [results file]

	ex:  jmeter -n -t ashokit_test_plan_1.jmx -l ashokit_test_results.jtl


=> After test is executed we can see result.jtl file

=> Import results file into summary report in JEMTER GUI to see the resutls.
