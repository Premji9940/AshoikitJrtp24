==========
SonarQube
==========

=> SonarQube is used for code quality checking

=> Using SonarQube we can perform Code Review

=> SonarQube will identify developers mistakes in source code

=> SonarQube software developed using Java Language

=> Using SonarQube we can perform code review for 30+ languages

	Ex: java, python, c#, JS, SQL etc......

Note: We can use SonarQube community edition for practice purpose. In companies we will use Enterprise Edition.

=> In SonarQube for every language rules are configured to check code quality.

Note: We need to make sure our project code quality gate is passed. If project code quality gate is failed then we shouldn't deploy that application.

===========================================
What kind of issues sonar will identify
===========================================

1) Bugs (Ex: NullPointerException)

2) Vulnerabilities (Ex: exposing password, pin etc...)

3) Code Smells (Ex: Unused imports, unused variables, unused private methods...)

4) Duplicate Code Blocks

5) Code Coverage (Unit testing coverage)


## Assingment : Perform 02-Mini Project code review using SonarCloud.

========================
SonarQube Server Setup
========================

1) We can install in windows directley

2) We can install in Linux directley

3) We can setup Sonar using Docker Image (below is the document for that)

Git Repo : https://github.com/ashokitschool/DevOps-Documents/blob/main/Sonar-Setup-Docker.md

4) We can use Sonar Cloud also (no need of any installation)


===================================
Spring Boot with Sonar Integration
===================================

1) Login into sonar server

2) Generate Sonar Token (Profile -> Account -> Security -> Generate Token)

3) Configure Sonar Server details in project pom.xml file

	<properties>
		<java.version>17</java.version>
		<sonar.host.url>http://3.6.91.108:9000/</sonar.host.url>
		<sonar.login>sqa_f45b445ca4afbd66083905d45a82551c21</sonar.login>		
	</properties>

4) Perform Maven build using sonar:sonar goal

5) After build got success, then check sonar dashboard to see code review report.
